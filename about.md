Hi there! I'm Magnus. This is my simple jekyll website. It is a kind of experiment in the world of static site generators.

I like to program and I am currently a computer science student and also an entrepreneur. I mainly have experience with
Java and C#, lately I have been learning JavaScript which has been a refreshing change. I like the prototypal inheritance
model in JavaScript and it's long history of functional programming.

To learn more about functional programming I am also studying Haskell which has been quite a challenge for me so far as
I am quite used to imperative programming in object-oriented languages.

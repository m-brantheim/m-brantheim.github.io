Hi there! I'm Magnus. This is my simple jekyll website. It is a kind of experiment in the world of static site generators.

I like to program and I am currently a computer science student and also an entrepreneur. I mainly have experience with
Java and C#, lately I have been learning JavaScript which has been a refreshing change. I like the prototypal inheritance
model in JavaScript and it's long history of functional programming.

To learn more about functional programming I am also studying Haskell which has been quite a challenge for me so far as
I am quite used to imperative programming in object-oriented languages.

In my early 20s I used to be a professional poker player, I did that for a few years. Mostly playing online poker tournaments,
it was quite hard work but also a lot of fun and exciting as well. Since I played online I was free to move anywhere so
I lived in Barcelona for a while and later on in Vancouver (for about a year).

I longed for some more meaningful work however and did not fancy spending my life grinding out poker games so I eventually
moved on. I initially started studying psychology at a university in Sweden as that has long been an interest of mine, but
decided I did not want a career in that field so I moved on once again to computer science and programming.

I have been studying CS for about 1,5 years. Have almost finished a 2 year degree program as a Java systems developer,
recently I also started a 3 year CS program focused on DevOps (studying at 200%, I am a bit crazy :D). I think DevOps
is and increasingly will be an important skill for most companies and especially in IT heavy fields. I think it can really
leverage and increase developer productivity and help companies deliver more value faster which is why I am interested in it.

I have some business ideas myself which I would like make real, and for that purpose I have started a company. I have
developed a simple prototype for a brain training system (based on the field of neurofeedback which I have been involved
in for a few years). The system can measure and train brain blood flow which in studies have been shown to increase
various psychological abilities like attention.

I have pitched these ideas to the incubator in Mid Sweden Science Park (in Ã–stersund, Sweden) and was accepted there.
This means I will have access to different business advisors who they have hired to assist the startup companies.
I don't know much about startups yet but I am trying to learn fast and to build my product at the same time.

I am really passionate about using computer science, programming and technology to build things that can actually help
people and to improve lives.

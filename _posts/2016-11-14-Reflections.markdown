-What do you think of pre-compiling your CSS?

Pre-compiling code is a common practice in web development, this could for example be to compile more recent
versions of JavaScript into an older version to run on older browsers. There are a growing number of languages like
ClojureScript, Elm and Haskell which can be compiled to JavaScript in order to run in the browser.
So pre-compiling CSS code is not such a huge step to add into a development workflow.
From a programmers perspective, CSS is quite a messy language so I am very happy if I can avoid it!

-Compare to regular CSS
CSS pre-processors extends CSS with additional capabilities that can be very useful to make cleaner code that is less
repetitive and better organized. The use of variables for example can be used to define a commonly used color, which
means you only need to change it in one place if you decide it is ugly!

-Which techniques did you use?


Pros and cons?

-What do you think of static site generators?
They can be useful for quickly making content-focused sites with static content... like blogs!

-What type of projects are they suitable for?
If only static content needs to be served and for example no user accounts are required (which would need a database
backing the site).

-What is robots.txt and how have you configure it for your site?
It is a file which can be read by web crawlers as they explore and index the web, the content you put in robots.txt
can instruct these web crawlers on how to behave on your site... there is no guarantee that they will however so it
is mostly a courtesy thing which might not be respected! Especially if your site is crawled to be potentially attacked
in some way.

-What is humans.txt and how have you configure it for your site?
This is a file to be read by the mythical human beast who (allegedly) also crawl the web along with their robot friends.
The purpose of this file is to share who has made the website and perhaps other kinds of information, like what technology,
techniques, tools etc were used in the process.
